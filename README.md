# Express Note Taker

## Description

This project is a note taker that can be used to write and save notes. 
Main functions of this app are: 
The app allows you take a note and save the note in local storage. I was unable to get the delete note to work, but the rest works.

## Usage
Run `npm start`
Copy: http://localhost:3001 into browser and click on the button to enter the app. The path of the app should change to http://localhost:3001/notes where the user will be able to enter notes and save them.
