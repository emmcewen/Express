# Express Note Taker

## Description

This project is a note taker that can be used to write and save notes. 
Main functions of this app are: 

When title is entered you may enter note. There should be a save icon in the upper left side of the page for saving notes and creating news. I could not get my app to work properly despite the amount of time I tried and many different ways to debug everything didn't seem to work. 

I also had a lot of trouble with Git, it kept locking me out of pushing to my main branch so I had to create a another branch and push files to that instead. I thought about deleting the entire repository but I had already spent far too much time trying to debug this app.
